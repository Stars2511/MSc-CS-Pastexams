Q4
-----------------------------------------
* Under light load, contention is preferable due to its low delay(collision-free methods have a longer delay)
* As load increases, contention becomes increasingly less attractive. Collision-free methods have a better channel efficiency.
* Limited contention protocols would be better because it combines the best properties of the contention and collision-free protocols, it uses contention at low loads to provide low delay, but uses a collision-free technique at high loads to provide good channel efficiency.
